                <h2>The best teacher of IIT and Medical at your home</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        In this age of competition almost each and every parent dreams that his/her child should study engineering from IIT or NIT or become a doctor from the best medical college. Thus allured/tempted by the advertisements and by giving lump sum fees, they get their children admitted in coaching institutions. But through coaching institutes, only such intelligent students get selected in competitive exams, whose IQ level is already high and those who need only slight guidance. Such coaching institutions give even 100% scholarship to such students and give them facilities of eating, lodging and boarding also. Some even give handsome amount of money to them, to study in their institution. Special batches of such students are made and they are taught by the best faculties. But the average students have to pay full fees and still they are ignored by the coaching institutions and are taught by unknowledgeable, inexperienced tutors who are not upto the mark. As such good knowledge of the subject, experience, the way of teaching, devotion, understanding the problems of the students are the essential qualities of a good Coach/Instructor.
